Twilio makes it easy to implement and integrate click-to-call directly into your web application.

== Description ==

Click-to-call enables your company to convert web traffic into direct communication over the phone, with just the click of a button.  A simple form on your webpage allows visitors to enter their phone number, and with the click of the “call” button their information is routed to agents who can then contact them to provide help, support, and other services.


= Click to call made easy =
Add click to call to your website in three simple steps.

* You sign up for Twilio.

* A visitor clicks a link to reach an agent and enters their phone number

* Twilio automatically connects the visitor and the agent

= HOW IT WORKS =
Let's go over the steps necessary to implement click-to-call in your website:

* A website visitor wants to connect to your organization. He submits a web form with his phone number to receive a call connecting her to your sales or support team.

* Your web application receives the form submission. An HTTP request is initiated from your application to Twilio to initiate an outbound call.

* Twilio receives the request and initiates a call to the user's phone number.

* User receives the call.

= Features =
* Clean install & uninstall.
* Direct contact with buyer via voice call.
* Backend interface to manage Twilio settings.
